(Railway Crossing Signaling System)
Write a program code in the ST language for a PLC according to the IEC/EN 61131 standard to control the railway crossing light signaling according to the following requirements.

The system has three states:

STOP
GO
OUT OF SERVICE
The state is controlled by the station signaling system (based on station signals) and does not have its own on/off elements. The station signaling system provides signals to the crossing controller:

OPEN activates the GO state.
STOP activates the STOP state.
OFF activates the OUT OF SERVICE state.
If no signals are received from the station signaling system, the controller enters the OUT OF SERVICE mode.
Light Behavior:
In the STOP mode, two red lights (R1 and R2) flash alternately at a 550 ms frequency.
In the GO mode, the white light (W) flashes at an 850 ms frequency with a 70% duty cycle.
In the OUT OF SERVICE mode, no lights are illuminated.
