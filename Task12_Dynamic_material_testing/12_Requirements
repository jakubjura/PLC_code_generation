Create a program for an automatic dynamic material testing system.

The dynamic loading is ensured by a linear pneumatic actuator. The actuator is equipped with end sensors and a suitable valve.

The actuator applies force to the component for 350 ms.
After that, it relieves the load for 600 ms.
If the component fails, the actuator moves to the end position, which is detected by a sensor, thus indicating the component's failure.
The control system continuously records the number of load cycles, and upon detecting a component failure, it saves the value to memory and stops the periodic activation of the actuator.
